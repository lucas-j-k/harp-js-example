"I fear thee, ancyent Marinere!  
"I fear thy skinny hand;  
"And thou art long and lank and brown  
"As is the ribb'd Sea-sand.  
  
"I fear thee and thy glittering eye  
"And thy skinny hand so brown—  
Fear not, fear not, thou wedding guest!  
This body dropt not down.  
  
Alone, alone, all all alone  
Alone on the wide wide Sea;  
And Christ would take no pity on  
My soul in agony.  
  
The many men so beautiful,  
And they all dead did lie!  
And a million million slimy things  
Liv'd on—and so did I.  
  
I look'd upon the rotting Sea,  
And drew my eyes away;  
I look'd upon the eldritch deck  
And there the dead men lay.  
  
I look'd to Heaven, and try'd to pray;  
But or ever a prayer had gusht,  
A wicked whisper came and made  
My heart as dry as dust.  
  
I clos'd my lids and kept them close,  
Till the balls like pulses beat;  
For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky  
Lay like a load on my weary eye,  
And the dead were at my feet.  
  
The cold sweat melted from their limbs,  
Ne rot, ne reek did they;  
The look with which they look'd on me,  
Had never pass'd away.  
  
An orphan's curse would drag to Hell  
A spirit from on high:  
But O! more horrible than that  
Is the curse in a dead man's eye!  
Seven days, seven nights I saw that curse,  
And yet I could not die.  
  
The moving Moon went up the sky  
And no where did abide:  
Softly she was going up  
And a star or two beside—  
  
Her beams bemock'd the sultry main  
Like morning frosts yspread;  
But where the ship's huge shadow lay,  
The charmed water burnt alway  
A still and awful red.  
  
Beyond the shadow of the ship  
I watch'd the water-snakes:  
They mov'd in tracks of shining white;  
And when they rear'd, the elfish light  
Fell off in hoary flakes.  
  
Within the shadow of the ship  
I watch'd their rich attire:  
Blue, glossy green, and velvet black  
They coil'd and swam; and every track  
Was a flash of golden fire.  
  
O happy living things! no tongue  
Their beauty might declare:  
A spring of love gusht from my heart,  
And I bless'd them unaware!  
Sure my kind saint took pity on me,  
And I bless'd them unaware.  
  
The self-same moment I could pray;  
And from my neck so free  
The Albatross fell off, and sank  
Like lead into the sea.
