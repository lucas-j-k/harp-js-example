It is an ancyent Marinere,  
And he stoppeth one of three:  
"By thy long grey beard and thy glittering eye  
"Now wherefore stoppest me?  

"The Bridegroom's doors are open'd wide  
"And I am next of kin;  
"The Guests are met, the Feast is set,—  
"May'st hear the merry din.  

But still he holds the wedding-guest—  
There was a Ship, quoth he—  
"Nay, if thou'st got a laughsome tale,  
"Marinere! come with me."  

He holds him with his skinny hand,  
Quoth he, there was a Ship—  
"Now get thee hence, thou grey-beard Loon!  
"Or my Staff shall make thee skip.  

He holds him with his glittering eye—  
The wedding guest stood still  
And listens like a three year's child;  
The Marinere hath his will.  

The wedding-guest sate on a stone,  
He cannot chuse but hear:  
And thus spake on that ancyent man,  
The bright-eyed Marinere.  

The Ship was cheer'd, the Harbour clear'd—  
Merrily did we drop  
Below the Kirk, below the Hill,  
Below the Light-house top.  

The Sun came up upon the left,  
Out of the Sea came he:  
And he shone bright, and on the right  
Went down into the Sea.  

Higher and higher every day,  
Till over the mast at noon—  
The wedding-guest here beat his breast,  
For he heard the loud bassoon.  
 
The Bride hath pac'd into the Hall,  
Red as a rose is she;  
Nodding their heads before her goes  
The merry Minstralsy.  

The wedding-guest he beat his breast,  
Yet he cannot chuse but hear:  
And thus spake on that ancyent Man,  
The bright-eyed Marinere.  

Listen, Stranger! Storm and Wind,  
A Wind and Tempest strong!  
For days and weeks it play'd us freaks—  
Like Chaff we drove along.  

Listen, Stranger! Mist and Snow,  
And it grew wond'rous cauld:  
And Ice mast-high came floating by  
As green as Emerauld.  

And thro' the drifts the snowy clifts  
Did send a dismal sheen;  
Ne shapes of men ne beasts we ken—  
The Ice was all between.  

The Ice was here, the Ice was there,  
The Ice was all around:  
It crack'd and growl'd, and roar'd and howl'd—  
Like noises of a swound.  

At length did cross an Albatross,  
Thorough the Fog it came;  
And an it were a Christian Soul,  
We hail'd it in God's name.  

The Marineres gave it biscuit-worms,  
And round and round it flew:  
The Ice did split with a Thunder-fit;  
The Helmsman steer'd us thro'.  

And a good south wind sprung up behind,  
The Albatross did follow;  
And every day for food or play  
Came to the Marinere's hollo!  

In mist or cloud on mast or shroud  
It perch'd for vespers nine,  
Whiles all the night thro' fog-smoke white  
Glimmer'd the white moon-shine.  

"God save thee, ancyent Marinere!  
"From the fiends that plague thee thus—  
"Why look'st thou so?"—with my cross bow  
I shot the Albatross.
