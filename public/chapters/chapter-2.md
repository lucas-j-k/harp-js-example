The Sun came up upon the right,  
Out of the Sea came he;  
And broad as a weft upon the left  
Went down into the Sea.  
  
And the good south wind still blew behind,  
But no sweet Bird did follow  
Ne any day for food or play  
Came to the Marinere's hollo!  
  
And I had done an hellish thing  
And it would work 'em woe;  
For all averr'd, I had kill'd the Bird  
That made the Breeze to blow.  
  
Ne dim ne red, like God's own head,  
The glorious Sun uprist:  
Then all averr'd, I had kill'd the Bird  
That brought the fog and mist.  
'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay  
That bring the fog and mist.  
  
The breezes blew, the white foam flew,  
The furrow follow'd free:  
We were the first that ever burst  
Into that silent Sea.  
  
Down dropt the breeze, the Sails dropt down,  
'Twas sad as sad could be  
And we did speak only to break  
The silence of the Sea.  
  
All in a hot and copper sky  
The bloody sun at noon,  
Right up above the mast did stand,  
No bigger than the moon.  
  
Day after day, day after day,  
We stuck, ne breath ne motion,  
As idle as a painted Ship  
Upon a painted Ocean.  
  
Water, water, every where,  
And all the boards did shrink;  
Water, water, every where,  
Ne any drop to drink.  
  
The very deeps did rot: O Christ!  
That ever this should be!  
Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs  
Upon the slimy Sea.  
  
About, about, in reel and rout  
The Death-fires danc'd at night;  
The water, like a witch's oils,  
Burnt green and blue and white.  
  
And some in dreams assured were  
Of the Spirit that plagued us so:  
Nine fathom deep he had follow'd us  
From the Land of Mist and Snow.  
  
And every tongue thro' utter drouth  
Was wither'd at the root;  
We could not speak no more than if  
We had been choked with soot.  
  
Ah wel-a-day! what evil looks  
Had I from old and young;  
Instead of the Cross the Albatross  
About my neck was hung.
